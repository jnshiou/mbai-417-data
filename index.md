# MBAi 417 Data & Data Intensive Systems
Instructor: Brook Miller

## Overview:
The exponential growth in data, more powerful algorithms and the scalability of cloud architectures enable the world’s most successful companies and create new data intensive opportunities for every organization.  In this class we’ll develop strong intuition of the principles driving the modern data ecosystem (database, data transformation, governance, discovery).  We’ll explore new cloud architectures for data intensive applications and how they impact companies’ abilities to deliver.  

We’ll build technical capabilities to develop insights from data and ensure data quality with a robust process for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).  

We'll be preparing students to plan, manage and lead effective teams in product & management roles. 

Each class will be a mix of lecture focused on cases / topics and labs to sharpen skills in using Python for EDA.  There will be 4 paired homework assignments and 1 small group reflection, no final, class participation will be important. 

## Learning Objectives:
You will learn to approach new data projects & products with a robust framework to enable success across acquisition, analytics, activation and archiving of data.  You'll gain an understanding of the key systems and data in the modern data stack including cloud and the challenges of moving data through data pipelines.  You will develop strategies to effectively govern data ensuring a robust process to ensure quality, regulatory compliance and security.  Finally, you'll build robust, iterative processes for EDA (exploratory data analysis) dealing with data quality issues and transforming data into robust features for AI modeling.

## <span style="color:red">Prerequisites</span>
Please familiarize yourself with a python notebook environment.  We'll ensure everything works in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  If you prefer another notebook environment and can self troubleshoot that is fine.

If you're not familiar with python programming in notebook environments please read [the overview](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb).


You should have completed MBAi 410: Computational Thinking for Business Leaders. We'll assume a level of Python knowledge building on that but more focused on using key libraries and manipulating data.

We'll be using SQL (not teaching SQL) so please do take the SQL Bolt tutorial as mentioned in the pre-reads for the first class.   You only need to complete Lessons 1-11 (SQL Lesson 1: SQL Lesson 1: SELECT queries 101 through SQL Lesson 11: Queries with aggregates (Pt. 2))
